                        It is aimed to make newcomers learn about Web of Things and speed their learning process.
                        Each section is short, therefore you can learn about WoT bit by bit.
                        At any time, you can come back and use this page as reference.
                        This material does not consist of only explanations but is also supported with code snippets that
                        you can work on
                        and try by yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end, you will have all the tools in your belt to build WoT applications.
                        With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards, protocol proxies and
                        translators,
                        smart internet-connected devices,
                        mash ups of WoT devices and services,
                        in many domains such as Smart Homes,
                        Factory Automation.

            <h3>Difference Between IoT and WoT</h3>
    
            <p>
                Before we explain WoT, lets first talk about what is the difference between the WoT and IoT. While IoT
                focuses on
                technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT leverages IoT and aims to provide interoperability
                between
                Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

        <div class="row">

            <h3>Thing Description</h3>
            <p>
                In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an IoT device or service. And TD (Thing
                Description) provides descriptive
                metadata for a Thing.

            <h3>Web of Things in a Nutshell</h3>
    
            <p>
                WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to streamline IoT application
                development by
                following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.
                With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases especially in
                cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.
                What can be achieved with the WoT is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and develop the WoT
                applications If you
                are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!
